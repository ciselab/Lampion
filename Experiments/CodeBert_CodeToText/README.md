# Lampion x CodeBERT

This folder contains experiments using Lampion and CodeBERT from the CodeXGlue Repository. 
Please see the company repository [CodeBERT Reproduction](https://github.com/ciselab/CodeBert-CodeToText-Reproduction) for a required Dockerimage.

Currently there are two experiments: 

- Java 
- Python 

Which are semantically very similar, but they start from different docker-images of the transformers.
Also, keeping it like this helped me to handle versions differently / better.

If not stated otherwise, no GPUs are used (needed).
