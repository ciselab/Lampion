    Transformer that wraps method-bodies in an If-True Statement.
    To be a bit cautious, while possibly applied everywhere, it is only applied at top-level method-blocks.

    IMPORTANT: This is not identical behaviour to the Java Transformer, as the Python Transformer does not need
    return statements. The Java Transformer needed some extra-hacks as it would maybe create dead branches
    (at least, dead on paper).
