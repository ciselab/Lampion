    Transformer that wraps literals in a lambda function that is immediately called.
    This procedure is often called an identity-function, hence the name of the transformer.
    Brackets are added pre-cautiously, even if they might be redundant.

    IMPORTANT: This is not identical behaviour to the Java Transformer, as the Python Transformer only works for Literals,
    while Java works on any typed element.
    TODO: Extend this behaviour for more elements than literals? In theory all expressions are fine.

    Before:
    > def example():
    >   return 1

    After:
    > def example():
    >   return ((lambda: 1)())

    The above added elements have redundant ( ) but I add them intentionally,
    so that I do not run into weird bugs about precedence.
    LibCST does not support finding this kind of behaviour afaik.

    Note: For some Transformers we need libcst.the parse_statement,
    however lambdas and function calls are both expressions, so all elements here are expressions.
